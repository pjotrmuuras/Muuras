                    answer: '“Muuras” is a compound word combining the Dutch words for wall (muur) and marsh (moeras). True to our Dutch heritage of water innovation, our technology combines the natural purifying abilities of wetland ecosystems with the space-efficiency of green walls. This creates a visually appealing facade that allows humans to live healthily and peacefully side-by-side with other animals and native plant species. '

                    question: 'What distinguishes Muuras from other living walls?',
                    answer: 'Living walls on the market today rely on a constant input of drinking water and imported fertilizer for their operation and often integrate invasive plant species. We believe that this is costly and unsustainable, especially in the face of growing drought and fertilizer shortages. Muuras systems instead use residential wastewater to feed and water the native plants in the wall, reducing costs for users and relieving pressure on drinking water sources.'

                    question: 'What type of buildings are suitable for installing a Muuras facade?',
                    answer: 'All buildings with available space on their facade or inside walls have the potential to get their own Muuras wetland wall. Certain factors can help you determine how easily our system can be applied to your building: Bigger systems are more cost-effective, and the presence of urinals, USTs or greywater diversion systems, as well as piping that is easily accessible, facilitate the installation of our system.

We made sure that our green wall is beneficial to the person paying for it, as well as for anyone who might walk by. Our main customers are architects, developers and VvE’s (Home Owners Associations), but Muuras systems are suitable for businesses and organisations just as well.'

The system allows for the reuse of water and helps with the thermal and noise insulation of your home, making your home more comfortable and reducing your spending on utility bills. '

                    question: 'What types of wastewater does Muuras recycle?',
                    answer: 'Muuras technology recycles wastewater from a mixture of greywater and nutrient-rich urine at a ratio of roughly 20:1. Sterile urine will be separated at the source with the usage of USTs (Urine Separating Toilets) in order to minimize infection risks. To further eliminate the risk of faecal contamination, this wastewater will be stored in a segmented septic tank for one month, which is in line with WHO’s guidelines for safe irrigation practices, before being mixed with greywater.'

                8: {
                    question: 'Does a Muuras facade smell bad?',
                    answer: 'We use well-established technologies to make sure our system operates safely and without producing odours. As water flows through the system, it remains underneath the soil level at all times, making sure gases are broken down into natural compounds before escaping. We use fragrant flowers such as water mint to actually make your wall smell better than before.'

                9: {
                    question: 'Do the plants in the Muuras facade die off?',
                    answer: 'Our aquatic plants are the star of the show, so we like to take good care of them. We exclusively use perennial plants that can handle the stress of frost, shade and wind and grow back up every year. To make sure plants remain healthy, beautiful and productive, we will come to maintain the facade twice a year.'

                    question: 'Do I need a permit for installing a Muuras facade?',
                    answer: 'In most cases, you will need an environmental permit (omgevingsvergunning) to install a green wall of any kind on the facade of your home. Depending on in what municipality you are located, requirements for requesting such a permit may differ. In some cases, such as for historic buildings, additional permits may be necessary. Luckily, most municipalities have an invested interest in green walls and will have a positive attitude towards installing them.'

                    question: 'Are there subsidies available for installing a Muuras facade?',
                    answer: 'In the face of changing weather patterns, municipalities in the Netherlands have recently become aware of the need to become climate adaptive. Therefore, they have a stake in increasing the amount of green spaces in their cities in space-efficient ways. Most major cities and some large towns offer subsidies to help fund green facades and roofs, while others have funding available for simply creating green spaces. Check with your municipality to see what support is available to you, or get in touch with us to help you on your way!'
